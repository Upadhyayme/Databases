# Databases
MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that enables users to store, manage, and retrieve structured data efficiently. It is widely used for various applications, from small-scale projects to large-scale websites and enterprise-level solutions.
The basic structure of the client-server structure involves one or more devices connected to a server through a specific network. Every client can make a request from the graphical user interface (GUI) on their screens, and the server will produce the desired output, as long as both ends understand the instruction. 

MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.
Records in a MongoDB database are called documents, and the field values may include numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, or even nested documents.
